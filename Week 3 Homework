MODULE 3 HOMEWORK DATA WAREHOUSE

Question 1: What is count of records for the 2024 Yellow Taxi Data?
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `terraform-demo-448721.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata`

Question 2:  Write a query to count the distinct number of PULocationIDs for the entire dataset on both the tables.
What is the estimated amount of data that will be read when this query is executed on the External Table and the Table

    SELECT DISTINCT PULocationID FROM `terraform-demo-448721.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata`;

    SELECT DISTINCT PULocationID FROM `terraform-demo-448721.nytaxi.external_yellow_tripdata`;

Question 3  Write a query to retrieve the PULocationID from the table (not the external table) in BigQuery.
Now write a query to retrieve the PULocationID and DOLocationID on the same table. Why are the estimated number of Bytes different?

  SELECT PULocationID FROM `terraform-demo-448721.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata`;
  SELECT PULocationID, DOLocationID FROM `terraform-demo-448721.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata`;

Question 4: How many records have a fare_amount of 0?
  SELECT fare_amount, COUNT(fare_amount) FROM `terraform-demo-448721.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata`
  WHERE fare_amount = 0
  GROUP BY fare_amount;

Question 5:  What is the best strategy to make an optimized table in Big Query if your query will always 
filter based on tpep_dropoff_datetime and order the results by VendorID (Create a new table with this strategy
  CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE terraform-demo-448721.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_optimised
  PARTITION BY DATE(tpep_dropoff_datetime)
  CLUSTER BY VendorID AS
  SELECT * FROM terraform-demo-448721.nytaxi.external_yellow_tripdata;

Question 6:  Write a query to retrieve the distinct VendorIDs between tpep_dropoff_datetime 2024-03-01 and 2024-03-15 (inclusive)
Use the materialized table you created earlier in your from clause and note the estimated bytes. Now change the table in the from 
clause to the partitioned table you created for question 5 and note the estimated bytes processed. What are these values?
  SELECT DISTINCT VendorID 
  FROM  `terraform-demo-448721.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata`
  WHERE DATE(tpep_dropoff_datetime) BETWEEN '2024-03-01' and '2024-03-15'

  SELECT DISTINCT VendorID 
  FROM  `terraform-demo-448721.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_optimised`
  WHERE DATE(tpep_dropoff_datetime) BETWEEN '2024-03-01' and '2024-03-15
